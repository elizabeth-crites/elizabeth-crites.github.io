        <p>
          I am a Research Associate in cryptography at The University of
          Edinburgh. I was previously a Research Fellow at University College
          London (UCL).
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Brown University in 2019. My
          dissertation, “Delegatable Anonymous Credentials from Mercurial
          Signatures," was completed under the supervision of Anna Lysyanskaya.

          Before entering the field of cryptography in 2016, my research focused on partial
          differential equations. I earned an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics
          from Columbia University under the supervision of Richard S. Hamilton
          and Michael I. Weinstein. I also hold a B.Sc. in Honours
          Mathematics from The University of Western Ontario.
